* Objective
  - To perform the Simulation of the Comparator experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/digital-logic-design-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Comparator/Comparator_01_Usability_smk.org][Comparator_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Experiment link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the Experiment page and click on 'For performing experiment' link 
  3. Select one basic element from the drop down displayed on the screen either AND,OR,NAND,NOR,XOR,XNOR,NOT(or)CONN.
  4. Select the number of nodes from the drop down list displayed on the screen either 2,3,(or)4
  5. Now choose the time pulse either a,b,c(or)d from the drop down list displayed on the screen and click on the 'new time impulse' button
  6. Select the adder either JK_flipflop or RS_flipflop and click on 'load it' button
  7. Now click on Simulate button 
  8. Select delete element and click on the element

* Expected result
  1. Experiment page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. A new tab should be opened with the simulation process page
  4. An image with the selected basic element and nodes should be displayed in the selected icon field
  5. The new time impulse values and the impulse image should be displayed on the screen
  6. The circuit with the selected adder should be displayed on the screen 
  7. The selected element should get deleted
