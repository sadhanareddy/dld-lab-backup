	In electronics, a flip-flop or latch is a circuit that has two stable states and can be used to store state information. The circuit can be made to change state by signals applied to one or more control inputs and will have one or two outputs. Flip-flops and latches are a fundamental building block of digital electronics systems used in computers, communications, and many other types of systems.
Flip-flops and latches are used as data storage elements. Such data storage can be used for storage of state, and such a circuit is described as sequential logic. When used in a finite-state machine, the output and next state depend not only on its current input, but also on its current state (and hence, previous inputs.) It can also be used for counting of pulses, and for synchronizing variably-timed input signals to some reference timing signal.
Flip-flops can be either simple (transparent or opaque) or clocked (synchronous or edge-triggered); the simple ones are commonly called latches. The word latch is mainly used for storage elements, while clocked devices are described as flip-flops.

<h2> NAND and NOR Latches</h2>
<h3> NOR Latch</h3>
	<p>
	<img src="../images/NOR.png" alt="2-d vectors"  />
<br />
	It can be constructed from a pair of cross-coupled NOR logic gates. The stored bit is present on the output marked Q.

While the S and R inputs are both low, feedback maintains the Q and Q outputs in a constant state, with Q the complement of Q. If S (Set) is pulsed high while R (Reset) is held low, then the Q output is forced high, and stays high when S returns to low; similarly, if R is pulsed high while S is held low, then the Q output is forced low, and stays low when R returns to low.

	</p>
	<h3> NAND Latch</h3>
<p>
	<img src="../images/NAND.png" alt="2-d vectors"  />
<br />
	This is an alternate model of the simple SR latch built with NAND logic gates. Set and reset now become active low signals, denoted S and R respectively. Otherwise, operation is identical to that of the SR latch. Historically, SR-latches have been predominant despite the notational inconvenience of active-low inputs
	</p>
	<h2> JK Flip Flop </h2>
<p>
	<img src="../images/master_slave.gif" alt="2-d vectors"  /><br />
JK flip flop is mostly implemented as Master Slave flip flop. The information present at at J and K inputs is transmitted to master flip-flop on positive edge of a clock pulse and held there until negative pulse occurs, after which it is allowed to pass through the slave flip-flop.
	</p>
<h2> JK Timing Digram </h2>

The following Digram depicts the change of JK flip flop Output with time pulse. It is negativve edge triggered.

		1) Design a master slave J-K flip flop as given in the Theory section. Use any of the clock cycles available. Give a sequence of J-K inputs for eg: 01, 10 , 00 , 00, 11 , 11, 01 etc and verify the output of the filp flop. Save this flip flop by marking appropriate inputs and outputs.
		<br/><br/>
		2) Import the J-K flip flop designed in 1st question. Connect the J-K to each other and label it as 'T'. The resulting flip flop is called a toggle flip flop. Generate a clock pulse or use any of the available ones. Verify that when T is 0, the output of flip flop does not change. When T=1, the output toggles at every negative edge of the clock. Save this circuit as a 'T' flip flop
		<br/><br/>
		3) Import the J-K flip flop designed in 1st question. Connect the compliment of J to K and label J as 'D'. The resulting flip flop is called a D flip flop. Generate a clock pulse or use any of the available ones. Verify that when D=1, output of flip flop is Q=1 and when D=0, output of flip flop is Q=0.  Save this circuit as 'D' flip flop.

		4) You are given a master slave RS flip flop made from NOR gates. Using this, design a circuit which behaves like a JK flip flop. The design can be like this :<br/>
