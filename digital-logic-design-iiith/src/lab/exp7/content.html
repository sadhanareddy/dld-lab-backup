 This module explains about how to build registers which are the units of memory storage in computers.
In computer architecture, a processor register is a small amount of storage available as part of a CPU or other digital processor. Such registers are (typically) addressed by other mechanisms than main memory and can be accessed more quickly. Almost all computers, load-store architecture or not, load data from a larger memory into registers where it is used for arithmetic, manipulated, or tested, by some machine instruction. Manipulated data is then often stored back in main memory, either by the same instruction or a subsequent one.

          	<p>
Registers can move two types of digital information: parallel and serial. Registers also have two basic ways of moving it: FIFO and LIFO. The simplest register is a FIFO, which is only one level deep and one bit wide. It is basically a single D Type Flip/Flop.
</p>
<h3> FIFO </h3>
<p>
A FIFO (First In First Out) is a digital device that moves data in the same way a queue would. The first chunk of information in is moved over as more is loaded in behind it. This continues until it is pushed out the end. Like a grocery line.
</p>
<h3> LIFO </h3>
<p>
A LIFO (Last In First Out) is a like a FIFO only the data comes out in the reverse order it came in. Data is processed like a stack data structure. Imagine putting items onto a stack, the first item taken off would be at the top of the stack. Thus, the last item in (item at the top of the stack), would be the first item out
</p>
<h3> Parallel </h3>
<p>
Parallel Registers take in mulitple bits at a time.
</p>
<h3> Shift Registers </h3>
<p>
Shift Registers are the simplest serial interfaces. They take serial data in one bit at a time and convert it to parallel form or the other way around. The first way is Serial In Parallel Out and the ladder is Parallel In Serial Out. Shift Registers are used to make larger state machines like counters and UARTs.

	the outputs as values or time-varying waveforms.

			terminals will have their saved names. The input and output nodes

			fail or give ambiguous result if the circuit does not stablizes
			with time. This can happen due to improper feedback circuitry. The
			underlying engine is not a full fledged circuit simulator and can
			get stuck at constructions involving certain feedback.</P>

		1) Design a simple register using 4 'D' flip flops and a common clock pulse. The register should copy new information from input to output at negative edge of every clock cycle.
		<br/><br/>
		2) Design a register with parallel load using 4 'D' flip flops, a common clock pulse and basic gates. The register should copy new information from input to output at negative edge of clock whenever the LOAD signal is 1 and should retain the old values when LOAD signal is 0.
		<br/><br/>
		3) Design a shift register which shifts its contents by 1 bit to the right at negative edge of the clock pulse. There will be a 'serial input' (SI) which comes at the output of leftmost flip flop. For ex:-  if register contains 0011 now and 1 is given as the serial input, then at next falling edge of clock pulse, register should contain 1001.
		<br/>
		HINT: Connect output of one flip flop to the input of next flip flop
