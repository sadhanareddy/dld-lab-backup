          <p>
	This module explains how to build a Programmable 1-bit ALU. 
	In computing, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit that performs arithmetic and logical operations. The ALU is a fundamental building block of the central processing unit of a computer, and even the simplest microprocessors contain one for purposes such as maintaining timers.
	
	
	
	</p>
	<img src="../images/ALU_symbol.png" alt="ALU"/>
	<br />
	<p>
Most ALUs can perform the following operations:
<br />
    Bitwise logic operations (AND, NOT, OR, XOR)
    <br />
    Integer arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, and sometimes multiplication and division, though this is more expensive)
    <br />
    Bit-shifting operations (shifting or rotating a word by a specified number of bits to the left or right, with or without sign extension). Shifts can be seen as multiplications and divisions by a power of two.
    <br />
    <br />
</p>
    <h3> Inputs and Outputs</h3>
<p>
    The inputs to the ALU are the data to be operated on (called operands) and a code from the control unit indicating which operation to perform. Its output is the result of the computation.

          <h2> Programmable 1-bit ALU </h2>
	<p>
	In this experiment, an Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) capable of performing 8 Arithmetic/Logic functions on 1-bit operands,
	will be designed, assembled and tested.
	The circuit will consist of two 8-input multiplexers (74LS151), one quad 2-input multiplexer (74LS157) and one quad 2-input XOR gate (74LS86), all belonging to the TTL family.

 <br/>
 <p>
 The final ALU output bits Y0 and Y1 will be generated by the two 8-input multiplexers – referred to as MUX0 and MUX1 respectively(both 74LS157).
MUX0 is always enabled, while MUX1 is enabled only when F2 = 1, i.e. for Arithmetic functions only. This is because Y1 is required only to provide the CARRY/BORROW output for Arithmetic functions.
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
The two 8-input multiplexers MUX0 and MUX1 require 16 inputs, they involve only 6 distinct Boolean functions of A, B, C – A • B, A’ • B, A + B, A’ + B, A ⊕ B and A ⊕ B ⊕ C. The first four terms are realised by four 2-input multiplexers
